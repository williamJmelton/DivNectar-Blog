# Nice Site! How'd you make it?

DivNectar is made using Gatsby.js. It's a static site generator...what's that, you ask? Great question. A static site generator takes a site with a bunch of content, spread across many files and modules and combines it to create essentially a bunch of "static" files...which is better for site performance, SEO, and much much more.

```js
console.log("wow")
```

## Okay...the blog part?

All of the blog posts that you'll read on my site are written in .mdx, a sub-dialect of Markdown that allows me to use javascript inside of the markdown. For example...if I had some interactive coding component, I could re-use that react component across any/all of my markdown posts. Pretty cool.

I also use react-prism to consume the source code blocks that I feed to my markdown files. By passing a custom component to replace the standard "pre" block that markdown converts too, I'm able to customize it's code and apperance. It's currently set to my favorite theme, Ayu Light. I know, it's a light theme...I like what I like ðŸ¤· Don't @ me.

## How about the styling?

The styling on the site is all done through styled-components...and it's all custom. I decided not to use a UI library for this version of the site. I just wanted it to look unique, and I really wanted to implement the Ayu color theme. I know not everyone likes a light theme, however.
